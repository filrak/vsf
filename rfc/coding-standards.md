# Coding standards

## General rules

- Where it makes sense we follow [AirBnb coding standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- We use Typescript features oriented around code reusability and developer experience (suggestions, error handling)
- We do follow progressive enhancement approach with all cutting-edge features
