# API Client package

Vue Storefront API client is a client-side micro-application built to consume Vue Storefront API. It provides a friendly abstraction layer over network calls and their params to make them easier to consume by other applications.  **It's a standalone package that can be used in any JavaScript project.**.

You can think about API client as enhanced data resolever from 1.x. API Client will be consumed by VS modules.

**API client is just a complementary layer of Vue Storefront API. It shouldn't be used to add new API endpoints. Instead we suggest creating dedicated modules for new features.**

API client will use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as it's the best HTTP Client lib out there. It can use either GQL API and REST API and is really good documented so we don't need to reinvent the wheel and spend time on docs.

## Responsibility and use case

API client responsibility is just to make an abstraction over VS API data operations.

For Vue apps we recommend using either core or Nuxt Module. API client is a low-level application to be used in other enviroments than Vue.

## Features

API client is very simple and focuses only on resolving data from the API and returning them in a fiendly format.

## Architecture
![Architecture](./assets/api-client.png)

**Input**
- **gets** data from Vue Storefront API
- **exposes** `setup()` function where you can set basic axios properties and modify endpoints.

**Output**
- **exposes** functions for data resolution (like `getProduct`, `makeOrder` etc)


## API

### Initialization with `setup()`

With this method we can setup global configuration for every request. You can pass every `axios.create()` ([ref](https://github.com/axios/axios#axioscreateconfig)) option here.

API Client ships with default configuration that can be overwritten by the user (so usually the only thing you add is `baseURL`)

**NOTE** Not certain yet
There is also `resolvers` object letting users modify every axios request to VS API. Every resolver is in a form of [axios request](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config).

**Examples**

**NOTE** `setup()` is needed only if you want to use API Client standalone. For Nuxt apps those options are hoisted into Nuxt config.
Setting up application just with `baseURL`
```js
setup({
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/'
})
```
Setting up advanced configuration and overriding (for future versions)

```js
setup({
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'},
  // Not decided yet, won't be in Develoeprs preview
  resolvers: {
    getProduct: {
      method: 'post',
      url: '/user/12345',
      data: {
        firstName: 'Fred',
        lastName: 'Flintstone'
      },
      transformRequest: [function (data, headers) {
        return data;
      }],
      transformResponse: [function (data) {
        return data;
      }]
    }
  }
})
```

### Getting data

Every request is just a axios request. You can override any request params just by passing axios properties to method arguments.

**Examples**

Get all categories (default behavior)
```js
import { getCategories } from '@vue-storefront/api-client'

let categories;

getCategories()
  .then({ data } => 
    categories = data
  )
```

Modify request to get categories
```js
import { getCategories } from '@vue-storefront/api-client'

let categories;

getCategories({ params: { 
    filter: { 
      id: 123 
      }
  }})
  .then({ data } => 
    categories = data
  )
```
