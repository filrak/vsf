# Dealing with updates

:::tip tl;dr

We have full control over what is and what is not an API. 90% of API is in Hooks which are standardized so breaking changes aren't very likely. API is 100% independent from implementation details of VS core and it's modules.

Upgrades will be seamless and we can provide tools for their automation without any problem
