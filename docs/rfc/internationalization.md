# Internationalization

For internationalization we want to use well-known and proven [`nuxt-i18n`](https://nuxt-community.github.io/nuxt-i18n/) module which has all required capabilities like translations lazy loading , automatic route geenration and custom domains support.

Internationalization will be optional and switchable through CLI during project scaffoding.
