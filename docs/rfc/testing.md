# Testing

:::tip tl;dr
We will cover every core package with unit tests and provide set of E2E tests out of the box for theme. E2E tests will be based on special html selectors. We will also add script to the cli that cheks if all special html selectors are still present in theme after changes.

We will use Jest and Cypress
