# Performance

## High-level rules
- We follow [RAIL model guidelines](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail#lighthouse) 
- We test performance before every merge to master with Lighthouse extension making sure it doesn't make Performance score worse than expected.
- Target PSI and Lighthouse performance score shouldn't be lower than 90 with default configuration and theme.
