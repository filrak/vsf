# Coding standards

## General rules

- Where it makes sense we follow [AirBnb coding standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- We use Typescript features oriented around code reusability and developer experience (suggestions, error handling)
- We do follow progressive enhancement approach with all cutting-edge features
- Every potentially replaceable third party integration API used in core building blocks (api client, core) should be abstracted (Dependency Injection) so we can easily swap it with other solution solving the same problem.
