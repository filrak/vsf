# Nuxt Theme

Nuxt theme is just a **scaffolding** template for out of the box working Vue Storefront shop. It's then consumed by CLI and outputs working Vue storefront project.

Before MVP is finished themes are just copied by the CLI. After MVP we will introduce some magic comments and theme configs to inject certain dependencies like CMS as well as option to generate a project without Storefront UI
